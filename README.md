# 🧠 Research Paper Summarizer (Model-Agnostic Framework)

This is a flexible and extensible framework for summarizing academic research papers (PDFs). Unlike rigid tools that lock you into a single model or API, this app lets you plug in **any LLM or summarization API you prefer**, while keeping the backend processing intact.

## 🔍 Features

- 📄 **PDF Upload & Parsing** – Read entire research papers with accurate text extraction.
- 🧩 **Automatic Chunking** – Split long texts into manageable segments for better summarization.
- 🧠 **Model-Agnostic Design** – Use any summarization model (OpenAI GPT, Cohere, local LLMs, etc.).
- 💬 **Streamlit Interface** – Intuitive web UI for uploading papers and reading summaries.
- ⚙️ **Easy Customization** – Swap out the summarizer backend with minimal effort.

## Project status

The PDF extraction, chunking, and Streamlit interface are present. OpenAI and Hugging Face adapters are included. Live summaries require a configured model and provider key; summaries should be checked against the source paper.
